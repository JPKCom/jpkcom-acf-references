/**
 * Consistency check: ACF meta values vs. real taxonomy term assignments.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The list shortcode filters references with `meta_query` + `LIKE '%"5"%'` over
 * the serialised ACF values. A leading wildcard cannot use an index, so every
 * clause scans the meta rows for that key — a fully populated filter produces
 * eight such clauses.
 *
 * All three taxonomy fields are configured with `save_terms => 1`, so ACF also
 * writes real term relationships, which *are* indexed. Switching the shortcode
 * to `tax_query` would therefore be much cheaper — but only returns identical
 * results if meta and term assignments actually agree for every existing post.
 * They can drift: an import, a direct DB write, or a WPML duplication that
 * never ran ACF's save routine leaves the meta set and the relationship
 * missing (or the reverse).
 *
 * This script reports that drift. It only reads — nothing is modified.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *     wp eval-file wp-content/plugins/jpkcom-acf-references/tools/check-term-sync.php
 *
 * Note: on an empty or freshly imported site an exit code of 0 means only that
 * nothing contradicts itself — with no posts it is trivially true and says
 * nothing about production data. Run this against the data you actually intend
 * to ship against.
 *
 * Optional: append `--` style arguments are not parsed; set the constants below
 * by editing them if you need a different batch size.
 *
 * EXIT CODE
 * ---------
 * 0 = meta and terms agree everywhere (safe to switch to tax_query)
 * 1 = drift found (listed per post)

/**
 * Term IDs assigned to a post, read in that post's own language.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST wp_get_object_terms()
 * ------------------------------------------
 * WPML rewrites term IDs to the *current* language. This script runs in the
 * site's default language, so a Hungarian post whose relation genuinely points
 * at the Hungarian term came back carrying the German one — while the meta
 * value, which WPML does not touch, still held the Hungarian ID. The result was
 * a reported mismatch for every translated post on a multilingual site: the
 * check that gates this migration was unusable precisely where the migration is
 * riskiest.
 *
 * Measured on a real installation: raw relation [43], meta ["43"],
 * wp_get_object_terms() [22] in the de context and [43] in hu.
 *
 * Switching to the post's own language for the duration of the read makes both
 * sides speak about the same language. On a monolingual site nothing happens —
 * the filter is not registered and the language stays what it was.
 *
 * @param int    $post_id  Post to inspect.
 * @param string $taxonomy Taxonomy slug.
 * @return int[] Term IDs, in the post's language.
